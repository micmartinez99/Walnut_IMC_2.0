 # Background & Aims
Diet affects cancer risk and plant-derived polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and cancer-preventive properties. Walnuts are an exceptional source of the polyphenolic ellagitannin, pedunculagin, that is converted into urolithins by gut microflora. The following study examines the impact of urolithin metabolism on inflammatory markers in blood and colon polyp tissue. 

# Methods
In this clinical trial, we have evaluated the effects of walnut consumption on urinary urolithins, serum inflammatory markers and immune cell markers in polyp tissues obtained from 39 non-obese and obese subjects, with and without polyps. Together with detailed food frequency data, we have performed in-depth and integrated computational analysis of metabolomics data combined with serum inflammatory markers and spatial imaging of polyp tissues using imaging mass cytometry (IMC). 

# Results
LC-MS/MS analyses of urine and fecal samples identifies a widely divergent capacity to form nine different urolithin metabolites in this patient population. Subjects with higher urolithin A formation exhibit significantly lower levels of several key serological markers of inflammation, including C-peptide, sICAM 1, sIL6R, Ghrelin, TRAIL, sVEGFR2, PDGF and MCP2, an effect that is more pronounced in obese individuals for several key markers. Furthermore, spatial analysis of IMC data of colon polyp tissues taken from patients shows a significant reduction of vimentin and CD163 expression in subjects with a higher capacity to form urolithin A. 

# Conclusions
These studies indicate that the ability to form urolithin A is linked to general anti-inflammatory responses, warranting further studies to better understand the role of urolithins in the inflammatory process. (Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT04066816).
