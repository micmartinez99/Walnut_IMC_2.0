# Walnut_IMC_2.0

# ABSTRACT 
# ----------

  # Background & Aims
The human diet can directly affect cancer risk, with plant-derived compounds such as the polyphenols often exhibiting antioxidant and cancer-preventive properties. Walnuts are an exceptional source of the polyphenolic ellagitannin, pedunculagin, that upon release of ellagic acid are converted to a complex panel of urolithin metabolites by microflora. Here, we seek to understand the impact of urolithin metabolic capacity on inflammatory markers in the blood and colon polyp tissue. 
  # Methods
In this pilot clinical trial, we have evaluated the effects of walnut consumption (2 oz per day for 21 days) on urinary urolithins, blood serum inflammatory markers and a panel of immune cell markers in polyp tissues from 39 non-obese and obese subjects with and without polyps. Together with detailed food frequency data, we have performed an in-depth and integrated computational analysis of metabolomics data combined with serum inflammatory markers and spatial imaging of polyp tissues using imaging mass cytometry (IMC).
